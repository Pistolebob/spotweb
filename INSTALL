== Installation requirements ==
Spotweb has been regulary tested on several different systems. Spotweb is mostly used on:

* Unix-based (Linux, FreeBSD) operating systems or small NAS systems like Synology and Qnap 
* Apache Webserver
* PHP v5.3 or higher (modules required: ctyle, curl, DOM, gettext, mbstring, xml, zip, zlib, gd, openssl)
* MySQL webserver.

Spotweb also supports PostgreSQL and SQLite where SQLite is the least supported and tested database engine.

Please run 'testinstall.php' from within your browser before attempting anything further with Spotweb and make sure
all items are checked 'OK'.
	
== Installation instructions ==
1. Ensure you have an database server installed (either MySQL or PostgreSQL)
2. Create an empty 'spotweb' database
3. Ensure you have a webserver running and PHP is configured for this webserver
3. Download Spotweb 
4. Unpack Spotweb to a directory of your choosing
5. Run 'install.php' from your browser until everything is 'OK'. Fix the parts which aren't OK.
6. Follow the wizard and perform the instructions as given by the wizard.

== Troubleshooting ==
When a white page appears instead of your Spotweb installation, this usually indicates an typing error in either
your ownsettings.php, dbsettings.inc.php or a configuration error in your webserver.

Please consult your Apache's errorlog for the exact error and fix it.
